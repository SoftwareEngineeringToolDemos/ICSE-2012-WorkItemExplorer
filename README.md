WorkItemExplorer was only a research prototype of an idea for a tool and the code and executable are not available and were never released. Please contact Christoph Treude (ctreude@gmail.com) for more information.

This repository was constructed by [Chris Brown](https://github.com/chbrown13) under the supervision of [Emerson Murphy-Hill](https://github.com/CaptainEmerson). Thanks to Christoph Treude for providing their tool to us for this project and their help establishing this repository.
